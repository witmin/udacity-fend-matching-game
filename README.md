# Udacity - Memory Game
by Millie Lin

## How the game was created
The memory game is created base on the starter kit: [Udacity memory game repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) and written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The timer is from the EasyTimer.js (http://albert-gonzalez.github.io/easytimer.js/) by Albert Gonz√°lez.

The animation is from [animista.net](http:/animista.net) by ANA TRAVAS.

## How to play the game
Click a card to open it, if two opened cards matches, they will keep opening. 
If two opened cards do not match, they will flip and you need to remember the symbol and explore the matched one. 

When all cards matches, you win. 

## What you can gain
Try to win the game with less moves and you will be awarded with more stars. 
Keep training your memory. 

Good luck.
